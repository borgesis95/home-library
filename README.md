### Main features

- **Logging**: For the logging within this app has been used [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) which is logging library where you can customize log visualization.

- **Errors handling:** Express already has its default error-handling middleware, however i decided to add a pretty straightforward custom middleware that log errors inside `error.log`.
